Episode 3: The ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Strikes Back

This package allows you to recover/downgrade your DJI FPV device to the included firmware.

Please see the downloaded package name or the file 'firmware/device' to assure you are flashing the correct device.

Devices are as follows:
* wm150 - DJI Air Unit
* lt150 - DJI Air Unit Lite (Caddx Vista, Runcam Link)
* gl150 - DJI FPV Goggles V1
* gp150/gl170 - DJI FPV Goggles V2

Preparation:
* Windows users: Install the necessary drivers using driver_installer.exe if you haven't already done so
* Linux users: Install fastboot with eg. 'sudo apt install fastboot'

In order to recover/downgrade your device:
* Have your device powered off
* Launch windows-runme.bat or linux-runme.sh according to your OS
* Power on your device
* Wait for flashing to finish

Please note that butter may not update the firmware version displayed in your Goggles and DJI Assistant for some devices. This is normal and flashing worked, keep calm and carry on.

Troubleshooting:

If running the package never gets past "[ ] Waiting for DJI Recovery device to enumerate.." here's what you can do:
* Make sure you've installed the proper drivers using driver_installer.exe
* Try another USB cable
* Try another USB port (2.0 if you have one) 
* Try restarting your PC
* Try another PC

Usually some combination of cables and USB ports will work. If not, find a friend with a PC willing to help out.
