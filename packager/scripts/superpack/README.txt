Episode 3.5: The Sequel Prequel Cashin

This package is for V2 Goggles and Windows users only. It:
* Downgrades your goggles to V01.00.0606
* Roots the Goggles usign margerine
* Upgrades your goggles to the latest included firmware

Preparation:
Install the necessary drivers using driver_installer.exe if you haven't already done so

In order to complete the process:
* Close DJI Assistant, Cura, PrusaSlicer, any fpv.wtf tabs and/or anything else that might grab the COM port for DJI devices
* Connect your powered off Goggles v2 via USB to the PC
* Launch windows-runme.bat
* Power on the goggles when told to do so
* Pay attention and power cycle your goggles if asked to do so midway in the process, this is normal
* Wait for everything to finish, this can take 10 minutes or more
* Install wtfos through the configurator at https://fpv.wtf
* Enjoy

Troubleshooting:

If running the package never gets past "[ ] Waiting for DJI Recovery device to enumerate.." here's what you can do:
* Make sure you've installed the proper drivers using driver_installer.exe
* Try another USB cable
* Try another USB port (2.0 if you have one) 
* Try restarting your PC
* Try another PC

Usually some combination of cables and USB ports will work. If not, find a friend with a PC willing to help out.
